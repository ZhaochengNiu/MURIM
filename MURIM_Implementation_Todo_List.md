# Implementation To-Do List for MURIM-based Federated Learning

## 1. System Setup:
- [ ] Setup a server and multiple client nodes.
- [ ] Ensure all nodes can communicate with the server.
- [ ] Implement a basic Federated Learning loop where client nodes can send updates to the server and receive the global model.

## 2. Client Node Development:
- [ ] Implement the local training process on client nodes.
- [ ] Integrate differential privacy mechanisms.
- [ ] Develop mechanisms to compute and send model updates to the server.

## 3. Server Development:
- [ ] Implement aggregation of model updates from client nodes.
- [ ] Refine the global model based on received updates.
- [ ] Send the updated global model back to client nodes for further training.

## 4. MURIM Mechanism:
- [ ] Develop the MURIM mechanism based on the thesis details.
- [ ] Ensure MURIM can evaluate and score client contributions.
- [ ] Implement the incentive mechanism to reward clients based on their contributions.

## 5. Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms:
- [ ] Integrate differential privacy into the Federated Learning process.
- [ ] Ensure privacy mechanisms do not significantly degrade the performance of the global model.

## 6. Testing and Evaluation:
- [ ] Test the system with synthetic data.
- [ ] Evaluate system performance in terms of model accuracy and convergence speed.
- [ ] Assess the effectiveness of MURIM in incentivizing and evaluating client contributions.
- [ ] Verify the robustness of privacy-preserving mechanisms.

## 7. Documentation and Reporting:
- [ ] Document the implementation details.
- [ ] Create a user manual or guide.
- [ ] Report findings or insights from the testing and evaluation phase.

## 8. Optimization and Refinement:
- [ ] Identify system bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- [ ] Refine and optimize the system for better performance and scalability.

## 9. Deployment:
- [ ] Deploy the system in a real-world environment.
- [ ] Monitor the system's performance and address issues.

## 10. Group Fairness:
- [ ] Research group fairness requirements and constraints.
- [ ] Implement fairness constraints or algorithms.
- [ ] Design metrics to measure system fairness.
- [ ] Monitor and adjust the system for fairness.

## 11. Security and Attack Defense:
- [ ] Identify potential attack vectors.
- [ ] Implement defense mechanisms against attacks.
- [ ] Monitor the system for anomalies or suspicious activities.
- [ ] Test system resilience by simulating attack scenarios.
- [ ] Develop a response strategy for detected attacks.

## 12. Evaluation and Testing (Extended):
- [ ] Assess the system's group fairness using designed metrics.
- [ ] Evaluate the effectiveness of defense mechanisms against attacks.

## 13. Feedback Loop:
- [ ] Establish a feedback collection mechanism.
- [ ] Use feedback to refine fairness mechanisms in the system.
